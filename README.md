# shake-fpga

## Assumptions/Dependencies

The following cli tools should be in PATH:

- `vivado`: if you want to build bitstreams
- `verilator`, `pkg-config` and c/c++ compilers: if you want to build the verilated models

The program should be run from the project root.

A `shake-fpga.yaml` file should be present in the project root.
